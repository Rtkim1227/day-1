    	<p id="thoughts"> I woke up this morning and had some ideas so I thought I'd share: </p>
    	<p>With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy.</p>
		<p>Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. With practice comes confidence. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Let's do it again then, what the heck.</p>
		<p>Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.</p>
		<p>The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Brown is such a nice color. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Let's make a nice big leafy tree.</p>
		<p>Do an almighty painting with us. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.</p>
		<p>We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. All kinds of happy little splashes. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Happy painting, God bless. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.</p>
		<p>It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.</p>
		<p>Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Just use the old one inch brush. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Let's get crazy. We'll play with clouds today. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.</p>
		<p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.</p>
